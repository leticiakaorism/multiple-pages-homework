    <h1>ü•ê Croissant</h1>
    <p>A croissant is a French pastry made from puff pastry in a crescent shape.
        It is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl
         but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough. Croissants are named for their historical 
         crescent shape. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, 
         then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, 
         flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.</p>
